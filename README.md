## HandMeAFile

just a small proof of concept

I regularly have to copy a file from and to remote shares or even on my local machine. These jobs do not really change. This tool remembers all the file paths copied via clipboard and can be used to repeatedly put the copied file paths back into clipboard.
It is like  a lightweight, single task, multi-clipboard application for file paths.

There is not much to setup or do, yet. Feature set will be expanded as the need arises. Otherwise it might be abandoned.
