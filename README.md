# HandMeAFile

just a small proof of concept

I regularly have to copy  file from and to remote shares or even on my local machine. Those do not really change. This tool remembers all the file paths copied via clipboard and can be used to repeatedly put the copied file paths into clipboard.
It is like  a lightweight, single task multi-clipboard application for file paths.

There is not much to setup or do, yet.
